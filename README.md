# PHYS220 CW 2

**Author(s):** Aaron Grisez, Preston Kamada

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-02-aareston.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-02-aareston)

**Due date:** 2016/09/13

## Specification

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise 2.6 (```coor.py```)
1. Exercise 3.12 (```pathlength.py```)
1. Exercise 3.20 (```kinematics.py```)

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```cw2.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section. Check that exporting the notebook to pdf via LaTeX produces nice results.

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

Relearning Python was extremely helpful, as well as having to get used to using SageMathCloud and GitHub together was a plus for me with this classwork.

I believe the kinematics question is poorly formulated, but I should have asked questions about it sooner.

## INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
Be sure to complete your assignments. You are missing problem 3, as well as your notebook. You also kept cruft in your source code from the template, did not properly document your code, and did not provide complete test coverage.

Remember that you are being assessed as a professional in this class. Turn in professional work that you are proud of, and that you would be willing to show an employer in the future. Also be sure that everyone contributes to the classwork equally, and that all people sign the honor pledge below. Communication is a key part of any functional job environment, so it is crucial that you develop those skills now.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Preston S Kamada, Aaron Grisez
